## ðŸš€ GitHub Actions and Allure Test Reports 

This repo automatically builds and publishes Allure dashboards for Playwright smoke and regression suites.

| Trigger                 | Test Suite  | Report URL                                                              |
|-------------------------|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| On every push           | Smoke       | https://guillermochussir.github.io/playwright-tests/                    |
| Nightly (cron schedule) | Regression  | https://guillermochussir.github.io/playwright-tests/                    |

### How It Works

1. **Smoke tests** run on every `push` and upload `allure-report-smoke`.  
2. **Regression tests** run on a nightly schedule and upload `allure-report-regression`.  
3. It downloads the chosen artifact and deploys it to the `gh-pages` branch.
